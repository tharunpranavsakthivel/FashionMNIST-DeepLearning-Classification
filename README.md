### **Fashion MNIST Image Classification using Deep Learning**

This repository contains code for training and evaluating a deep learning model to classify fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The implemented model achieves a validation accuracy of 96% and a test accuracy of 96%.

### **Project Overview**

This project focuses on classifying fashion items (e.g., shirts, pants, shoes) from grayscale images using deep learning techniques. The model architecture includes convolutional layers for feature extraction and dense layers for classification. Two stages of training were employed: **pretraining** on a subset of classes (labels 0 to 4) and **transfer learning** on the remaining classes (labels 5 to 9).

### **Dataset**

The [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) was used in this project. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28 pixels.

### **Project Structure**

1. **Loading and Preprocessing Data**
   - The dataset was loaded and split into training and test sets.
   - Images were normalized to the range [0, 1] and reshaped to (28, 28, 1) to fit the model input.

2. **Pretraining Stage**
   - **Pretraining Data**: Images and labels corresponding to classes 0 to 4.
   - **Model Architecture**: Convolutional layers followed by dense layers for classification.
   - **Training**: The model was trained on pretraining data for 20 epochs.
   - **Evaluation**: Achieved a validation accuracy of approximately 96%.

3. **Transfer Learning Stage**
   - **Transfer Learning Data**: Images and labels corresponding to classes 5 to 9.
   - **Model Architecture**: Convolutional layers (frozen from pretraining) followed by additional dense layers.
   - **Training**: The model was fine-tuned (transfer learning) on transfer learning data for 20 epochs.
   - **Evaluation**: Achieved a test accuracy of 96%.

4. **Model Evaluation and Analysis**
   - **Performance Metrics**: Precision, recall, and confusion matrix were computed for model evaluation.
   - **Fit Analysis**: The model showed a good fit, indicating that it learned the patterns effectively.

### **Results**

- **Validation Accuracy**: 96%
- **Test Accuracy**: 96%
- **Precision**: High precision indicating low false positive rate.
- **Recall**: High recall indicating low false negative rate.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed breakdown of model predictions.
- **Fit Analysis**: The model is a good fit, balancing accuracy and overfitting/underfitting.

### **Next Steps**

1. **Image Augmentation**: Apply image augmentation techniques to further diversify the training data and enhance model generalization.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different hyperparameters (learning rate, dropout rate, etc.) to optimize the model's performance further.

3. **Model Ensembling**: Explore ensemble methods by combining predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy and robustness.

4. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model for real-time predictions, possibly as part of a web or mobile application.

### **Conclusion**

This project successfully demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques for accurate classification of fashion items. The achieved accuracy of 96% on both validation and test sets showcases the effectiveness of the implemented model. Further enhancements, including image augmentation and hyperparameter tuning, could potentially push the model's performance even higher.
